# Agent Summary: Cloudflare quick start + lint/test fixes

## What changed
- Fixed Prettier issues in `packages/form-builder/src/__tests__/deployment/cloudflare.test.ts`.
- Ensured `@emma/form-builder` uses non-watch tests by default (`vitest --run`).
- Verified full test suite passes across workspaces.
- Added `docs/developer-guide/cloudflare-quickstart.md` with concise setup and deployment steps.

## Why
- Prettier failures were breaking CI.
- Non-watch tests avoid interactive hangs in CI.
- Quick start provides a practical path for users deploying to Cloudflare R2.

## Quality gates
- Lint: PASS (after formatting fix)
- Tests: PASS (`yarn test --run` across all workspaces)
- Typecheck: PASS (workspace typechecks succeeded)

## Next steps
- Consider a provider dry-run mode to avoid `process.exit` in library code, improving testability.
- Expand quick start with an example Hugo shortcode snippet referencing the deployed CDN URLs.
