# Agent Summary: Snapshot-Based Form Versioning Implementation

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Related Issue:** feat(forms): Implement snapshot-based form versioning (emma edit, emma history)
**Pull Request:** copilot/implement-form-versioning

## Summary

Successfully implemented complete snapshot-based form versioning system as specified in `docs/05-architectural-decisions.md` Section 3. This feature enables immutable form versions with timestamp-based tracking, allowing users to maintain complete history and deploy any version at any time.

## What Was Accomplished

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Snapshot Tracking Types**
   - `FormSnapshot` interface with timestamp, r2Key, changes, and deployed status
   - `FormRegistry` and `FormRegistryEntry` for R2 storage
   - Enhanced `FormSchema` with `createdAt`, `lastModified`, `currentSnapshot`, and `snapshots` array
   - Field-level `addedAt` timestamps

2. **New CLI Commands**
   - **`emma edit <form-id>`** - Interactive form editor
     - Add/edit/remove fields
     - View current fields
     - Save with automatic snapshot creation
     - Prompts for change description
   - **`emma history <form-id>`** - Snapshot timeline viewer
     - Shows all snapshots sorted newest first
     - Displays timestamp, date, bundle name, and changes
     - Indicates current and deployed snapshots
     - Suggests commands for building/deploying specific versions

3. **Enhanced Existing Commands**
   - **`emma create`** - Now initializes snapshot tracking
     - Sets `createdAt`, `lastModified`, `currentSnapshot`
     - Creates initial snapshot with "Initial version" change
     - Marks all fields with `addedAt` timestamp
   - **`emma build --snapshot <timestamp>`** - Build specific snapshot
     - Generates timestamp-based bundle names
     - Validates snapshot exists before building
     - Shows snapshot date in output
   - **`emma deploy cloudflare --snapshot <timestamp>`** - Deploy specific version
     - Deploys historical snapshots
     - Updates registry with deployed snapshot
     - Marks snapshot as deployed in local schema

4. **Registry Management**
   - Creates/updates `registry.json` in R2 bucket root
   - Tracks all forms with current snapshots
   - Lists all available snapshots per form
   - Includes public URLs for current bundles
   - Supports multiple forms in same bucket

5. **Timestamp-Based Bundle Naming**
   - Format: `<form-id>-<timestamp>.js`
   - Immutable bundles stored independently
   - Multiple versions can coexist in R2
   - Easy rollback to any version

## Testing Results

### Automated Tests
- **Total Tests:** 80 passing (0 failed)
- **New Tests:** 5 snapshot workflow integration tests
- **Updated Tests:** Cloudflare deployment tests
- **Coverage:** All snapshot features tested
- **Security:** CodeQL scan clean (0 alerts)
- **Code Review:** No issues found

### Manual Testing
Successfully tested complete workflow:
- ‚úÖ Form creation with initial snapshot
- ‚úÖ Form listing
- ‚úÖ History viewing with multiple snapshots
- ‚úÖ Building current snapshot
- ‚úÖ Building specific historical snapshot
- ‚úÖ Bundle naming verification (timestamp-based)
- ‚úÖ Multiple bundles coexisting

## Example Usage

```bash
# Create a form (automatically creates first snapshot)
$ emma create contact-form

# Edit the form (creates new snapshot)
$ emma edit contact-form
# Interactive prompts guide through changes

# View complete history
$ emma history contact-form
üìú Snapshot History for "Contact Form"
Snapshot 2 ‚óè CURRENT
  Timestamp: 1729189000
  Changes: Added phone number field
Snapshot 1
  Timestamp: 1729089000
  Changes: Initial version

# Build current version
$ emma build contact-form

# Build specific historical version
$ emma build contact-form --snapshot 1729089000

# Deploy current version
$ emma deploy cloudflare contact-form

# Deploy specific historical version (rollback)
$ emma deploy cloudflare contact-form --snapshot 1729089000
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Unix Timestamps Instead of Semantic Versioning**
   - Simpler - no manual version management
   - Automatic - generated on save
   - Sortable - chronological order maintained
   - Unique - no conflicts

2. **Flat Bundle Storage in R2**
   - `form-id-timestamp.js` at bucket root
   - Easy to reference and manage
   - No directory structure complexity
   - Registry provides organization

3. **Immutable Snapshots**
   - Once created, never modified
   - Safe rollback at any time
   - No migration complexity
   - Complete audit trail

4. **Local YAML as Source of Truth**
   - All history in version control
   - No database required for versions
   - Easy backup and portability
   - Git-friendly format

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation fully aligns with `docs/05-architectural-decisions.md` Section 3:
- ‚úÖ Linear history with timestamp-based snapshots
- ‚úÖ Immutable bundles in R2
- ‚úÖ Registry for form discovery
- ‚úÖ Complete local history in YAML
- ‚úÖ Any snapshot independently deployable
- ‚úÖ No database storage for versions

## Benefits

1. **For Developers:**
   - Complete form history in version control
   - Easy rollback to any version
   - No breaking changes on form updates
   - Clear audit trail of changes

2. **For Users:**
   - Instant rollback on issues
   - A/B testing different versions
   - Safe experimentation
   - No data loss on form changes

3. **For Operations:**
   - No database migrations needed
   - Simple backup/restore
   - Clear deployment tracking
   - Multiple versions deployable

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

While all requirements are met, potential future additions:
- Snapshot comparison tool (`emma diff`)
- Automatic snapshot cleanup/archival
- Visual timeline in CLI
- Snapshot tagging/labeling
- Export/import snapshot sets
