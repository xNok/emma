# Task Summary: Landing Page Generation

This task involved modifying the `emma build` command to generate a new `index.html` file that serves as a landing page for the built form.

## Key Changes

- **Landing Page Template:** Created a new `landing-page.template.html` file with the required structure, including a footer with a link to the project's GitHub repository.
- **Form Builder Logic:** Added a new `generateLandingPageHtml` method to the `FormBuilder` class to process the new template and generate the `index.html` file.
- **Preview Page Renaming:** Renamed the existing preview page from `index.html` to `preview.html` to avoid conflicts.
- **Test Updates:** Updated all relevant tests to reflect the file renaming and added new tests to verify the generation of the `index.html` landing page.
- **Local Deployment Server:** Updated the local deployment server to serve the new `index.html` file from the `/forms/:formId` route.
