# Agent Summary: Snapshot-Aware Submission Storage Implementation

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** âœ… Phase 1 Complete - Storage Implementation
**Related Issue:** feat(api): Implement snapshot-aware submission storage & viewer
**Pull Request:** copilot/implement-snapshot-aware-storage

## Summary

Implemented snapshot-aware submission **storage** as specified in `docs/05-architectural-decisions.md` Section 4. This feature enables submissions to be tagged with form snapshots, ensuring proper data context as forms evolve.

**Important Architectural Decision**: For security reasons, submission viewing, export, and comparison functionality will be implemented in the Emma CLI rather than exposed through public API endpoints. The API worker only handles secure submission storage.

## What Was Accomplished

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Created migration `0002_add_submission_snapshot_fields.sql`
   - Added `form_snapshot` (INTEGER) and `form_bundle` (TEXT) columns
   - Created index on `form_snapshot` for efficient querying
   - Fully backward compatible with existing data

2. **Snapshot Metadata Storage**
   - Updated `SubmissionRepository` interface to accept snapshot parameters
   - Modified `submit` handler to capture current form snapshot
   - Generates bundle name from form ID and snapshot timestamp
   - Gracefully handles forms without snapshot metadata (legacy support)

3. **Repository Methods for Future CLI Use**
   - `getSubmissions()` - Retrieve submissions with filtering
   - `getSubmissionsByFormId()` - Get all submissions for a form
   - `saveSubmission()` - Store submission with snapshot metadata
   - These methods are available for future CLI commands

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - **submission-viewing-guide.md**: Overview of snapshot-aware submissions (CLI focus)
   - **export-format.md**: Export format specification (CLI focus)
   - **form-change-strategies.md**: Decision guide for edit vs. create new form

## Technical Implementation

2. **`packages/api-worker/src/handlers/submit.ts`** (12 lines changed)

   - Tests for backward compatibility (no snapshot)
   - Tests for submission validation
   - 6 tests total, all passing

## Security Architecture

### Why CLI Instead of API?

Exposing submission data through public API endpoints creates significant security risks:
- Submissions contain sensitive user data (PII)
- Public endpoints are vulnerable to unauthorized access
- Requires complex authentication/authorization
- Increases attack surface

### Secure CLI Approach

The CLI provides secure access because:
- âœ… Uses Cloudflare credentials already configured
- âœ… Direct D1 database access (no public exposure)
- âœ… Runs in authenticated user environment
- âœ… Follows principle of least privilege
- âœ… No additional authentication layer needed

## Testing Results

### Automated Tests

- **Total Tests**: 94 passing (0 failed)
  - API Worker: 6 tests (submission storage only)
  - Form Builder: 88 tests
- **Coverage**: All snapshot storage features tested
- **Security**: CodeQL scan clean (0 alerts)

### Test Coverage

âœ… **Snapshot Storage**
- Submission with snapshot metadata
- Submission without snapshot (backward compatible)
- Bundle name generation
- Error handling

## Database Storage

Submissions are stored with snapshot information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  form_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  data TEXT NOT NULL,
  meta TEXT,
  spam_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  form_snapshot INTEGER,           -- NEW: Unix timestamp
  form_bundle TEXT,                 -- NEW: Bundle filename
  FOREIGN KEY (form_id) REFERENCES forms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_form_snapshot ON submissions(form_snapshot);
```

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation aligns with `docs/05-architectural-decisions.md` Section 4:

- âœ… Store form_snapshot with each submission
- âœ… Store form_bundle reference for traceability
- âœ… No database migrations required for form changes
- âœ… Data integrity maintained

**Deferred to CLI** (for security):
- ðŸ”„ Submission viewer with snapshot awareness
- ðŸ”„ Export functionality with snapshot metadata
- ðŸ”„ Form comparison tool

## Future Work: CLI Implementation

The following commands need to be implemented in the Emma CLI:

### Submission Management
```bash
emma submissions list <form-id>
emma submissions list <form-id> --snapshot <timestamp>
emma submissions export <form-id> --format json|csv
```

### Form Comparison
```bash
emma forms compare <form-id> <snapshot1> <snapshot2>
```

### Implementation Notes
- Use D1 client to access database directly
- Leverage existing Cloudflare credentials
- Reuse repository methods already implemented
- Follow CLI patterns from existing commands

## Benefits

1. **Security**:
   - Submissions not exposed via public API
   - Authenticated access only
   - Reduced attack surface

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Complete snapshot context stored
   - No migrations on form changes
   - Historical accuracy maintained

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Repository methods ready for CLI
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented patterns

## Acceptance Criteria Status

From the original issue:

âœ… **Add form_snapshot and form_bundle fields to submission storage**
- Migration created
- Fields added to repository
- Tests verify storage

âœ… **Update API worker to store form snapshot and bundle reference**
- Submit handler captures snapshot
- Repository saves metadata
- Backward compatible

ðŸ”„ **Create submission viewer** (Moving to CLI)
- Viewer endpoints removed from API
- Repository methods available
- CLI implementation pending

ðŸ”„ **Export functionality** (Moving to CLI)
- Export handlers removed from API
- Format documented
- CLI implementation pending

ðŸ”„ **Form comparison tool** (Moving to CLI)
- Comparison endpoint removed from API
- Logic can be reused in CLI
- CLI implementation pending

âœ… **Documentation**
- Viewing guide created (CLI focus)
- Export format documented
- Change strategies documented

## Conclusion

Successfully delivered snapshot-aware submission **storage** with proper security architecture. The API worker now safely stores submission data with snapshot context, while keeping sensitive data access restricted to authenticated CLI users.

This approach provides:
- âœ… Secure submission storage
- âœ… Complete snapshot tracking
- âœ… Backward compatibility
- âœ… Foundation for CLI viewing/export
- âœ… No public exposure of sensitive data

**Next Steps**: Implement viewing, export, and comparison commands in the Emma CLI.
