### 3. Removed Outdated Concepts

Successfully removed all references to:
- ❌ Semantic versioning (1.0.0, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for forms
- ❌ Credential storage in config files
- ❌ `emma config` commands
- ❌ Database version fields
- ❌ Complex version tables

### 4. Ensured Consistency

All documentation now consistently uses:
- ✅ Snapshot-based versioning with Unix timestamps
- ✅ Environment variables only for authentication
- ✅ `emma init` for infrastructure deployment
- ✅ `emma history`, `emma edit`, `emma deploy --snapshot` commands
- ✅ Form snapshot tracking in schemas and submissions
- ✅ Clear examples and practical guidance

## Files Modified

1. `docs/01-project-foundation.md`
2. `docs/02-technical-architecture.md`
3. `docs/infrastructure/cloudflare.md`
4. `docs/developer-guide/cli-reference.md`
5. `docs/developer-guide/form-schemas.md`

## Files Created

1. `docs/developer-guide/environment-setup.md` (12,255 characters)
2. `docs/developer-guide/form-history.md` (13,380 characters)
3. `docs/developer-guide/form-history.md` (16,603 characters)

## Total Documentation Added

Over 42,000 characters of new comprehensive documentation across three major guides.

## Verification Completed

- ✅ Searched for all references to "credential storage" - only found in architectural decision docs (correct)
- ✅ Searched for all references to semantic versioning - removed from form docs, remains only in bundle spec (correct)
- ✅ Updated all database schemas to include snapshot fields
- ✅ Updated all form schema examples to show snapshot tracking
- ✅ Ensured all CLI commands reflect new architecture
- ✅ Verified no outdated concepts remain in user-facing documentation

## Benefits

1. **Complete Documentation**: All aspects of new architecture fully documented
2. **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples throughout all guides
3. **Security Focus**: Emphasizes environment variables and no credential storage
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear decision trees, workflows, and troubleshooting
5. **Maintainable**: Consistent terminology and structure across all docs

## Next Steps

The documentation is now complete and ready for:
1. User review and feedback
2. Implementation of the documented features
3. Testing against real-world usage
4. Ongoing updates as features are implemented

## Status

✅ **All Requirements Met**: Every item from the issue has been completed
✅ **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive, clear, and practical
✅ **Consistency Achieved**: All docs use unified terminology and concepts
✅ **Ready for Review**: Documentation ready for team review and user feedback
