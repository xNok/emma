# Agent Summary: Architectural Decisions for Foundation Questions

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Revised based on feedback)  
**Related Issue:** Finalize outstanding project foundation questions

## What Was Accomplished

I addressed the three critical architectural questions that were blocking v1.0 development, incorporating feedback to simplify the approach significantly.

### 1. Created Revised Architectural Decisions Document

**File:** `docs/05-architectural-decisions.md`

This document provides formal decisions with significantly simplified approaches based on project maintainer feedback:

#### Authentication Strategy (Section 2)

**Decision**: Environment variables only - NO credential storage

- **No Local Storage**: Emma CLI will never store credentials, even encrypted
- **Environment Variables**: All auth via `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: `emma init` handles complete setup including API worker deployment
- **Reconfiguration**: `emma init --override` restarts setup process
- **No config commands**: Removed `emma config` - not needed with env vars only

**Key Change from Original**: Original approach included encrypted credential storage in `~/.emma/config.json`. New approach: NEVER store credentials.

#### Form Versioning (Section 3)

**Decision**: Linear history with timestamp-based immutable snapshots

- **No Semantic Versioning**: Replaced MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH with simple timestamp-based snapshots
- **Snapshot Approach**: Each edit creates `contact-form-<timestamp>.js`
- **R2 Storage Only**: All version data in R2, not database
- **Simple History**: Local YAML tracks all snapshots
- **New Commands**: `emma history`, `emma edit`, `emma deploy --snapshot`

**Key Change from Original**: Original used semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0, etc.) with database storage. New approach uses timestamps and R2 only.

#### Form Changes & Migrations (Section 4)

**Decision**: Create new forms for major changes - NO migrations

- **Minor Changes**: Edit creates new snapshot of same form
- **Major Changes**: Create new form (e.g., `contact-form-v2`)
- **No Database Migrations**: Form changes never trigger migrations
- **Snapshot Tagging**: Each submission stores its form_snapshot
- **Display Logic**: Viewer shows fields that existed when submitted

**Key Change from Original**: Original included migration strategies and database tables for version history. New approach: avoid migrations entirely by creating new forms.

### 2. Removed Separate Issues Document

**Change**: Based on feedback, removed `docs/ACTIONABLE-ISSUES.md` and incorporated actionable issues into this summary.

### 3. Updated Foundation Document

**File:** `docs/01-project-foundation.md`

- Marked all open questions as resolved
- Added links to specific sections in the architectural decisions document

## Actionable Implementation Tasks

Based on the architectural decisions, here are the implementation tasks ready for GitHub issues:

### Issue 1: Implement Environment-Based Authentication & Infrastructure Deployment

**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Requirements**:

- [ ] Implement environment variable validation for:
  - `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`
  - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- [ ] Create `emma init` command with:
  - Provider selection (Cloudflare, custom, etc.)
  - Environment variable verification
  - R2 bucket creation
  - API worker deployment via Wrangler
  - D1 database creation and migration
  - Infrastructure health checks
- [ ] Add `emma init --override` for reconfiguration
- [ ] Store only non-secret config in `~/.emma/config.json`

- Works in CI/CD environments

### Issue 2: Implement Snapshot-Based Form Versioning

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Requirements**:

- [ ] Add snapshot tracking to form YAML schema:
  - `currentSnapshot` field
  - `snapshots` array with timestamp, r2Key, changes
  - `addedAt` field for form fields
- [ ] Implement timestamp-based bundle naming:
  - Format: `<form-id>-<timestamp>.js`
- [ ] Create `emma edit` command:
  - Interactive field editing
  - Generates new snapshot on save
  - Updates currentSnapshot pointer
- [ ] Build `emma history <form-id>` command:
  - Shows all snapshots with timestamps
  - Displays changes for each snapshot
- [ ] Implement registry.json management:
  - Stored in R2 at `registry.json`
  - Lists all forms with current snapshots
  - Updated on each deployment
- [ ] Add `emma deploy --snapshot <timestamp>` for rollback

**Testing**:

- [ ] Test snapshot creation on form edit
- [ ] Test history command shows all snapshots
- [ ] Test deploying specific snapshot
- [ ] Test registry.json updates correctly
- [ ] Test multiple forms in same bucket

**Documentation**:

- [ ] Snapshot workflow guide
- [ ] When to create new forms vs. edit existing
- [ ] `emma history` and `emma edit` documentation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Each edit creates new immutable snapshot
- Complete history maintained in local YAML
- Any snapshot can be deployed independently
- No database storage for versions

### Issue 3: Implement Snapshot-Aware Submission Storage

**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Requirements**:

- [ ] Add `form_snapshot` field to submission storage
- [ ] Add `form_bundle` field for full traceability
- [ ] Update API worker to store snapshot with submission
- [ ] Create submission viewer with:
  - Grouping by form ID
  - Snapshot indicator for each submission
  - Field display based on snapshot
  - "N/A" for fields not in snapshot
- [ ] Add submission export with snapshot metadata
- [ ] Build form comparison tool:
  - Compare fields between snapshots
  - Show added/removed fields
  - Highlight changes

**Testing**:

- [ ] Test submissions store correct snapshot
- [ ] Test viewer groups by form ID
- [ ] Test display of submissions from different snapshots
- [ ] Test export includes snapshot metadata
- [ ] Test comparison between snapshots

**Documentation**:

- [ ] How snapshot affects submission display
- [ ] Export format documentation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All submissions tagged with snapshot timestamp
- Viewer correctly handles submissions from different snapshots
- No migration needed when form changes
- Export includes complete snapshot information

### Issue 4: Update Documentation

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**Requirements**:

- [ ] Update `docs/infrastructure/cloudflare.md`:

- Snapshot approach fully documented

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Issue 1**: Authentication & Infrastructure (Critical) - Blocks everything
2. **Issue 2**: Snapshot Versioning (High) - Needed for form management
3. **Issue 4**: Documentation (High) - Supports implementation
4. **Issue 3**: Submission Storage (Medium) - Long-term feature

**Total Estimated Effort**: 8-12 days

## Key Benefits of Revised Approach

1. **Simpler**: No credential management, no semantic versioning
2. **More Secure**: Zero credential storage anywhere
3. **More Maintainable**: R2-only storage, no database complexity
4. **Better UX**: Timestamps easier than version numbers
5. **Cleaner**: Creating new forms for major changes avoids migration complexity

## Status

- Blocker for Cloudflare deployment feature
- Tasks: R2 S3 client, credential management, setup wizard

### Phase 2: Schema Versioning (High Priority)

- Estimated effort: 3-4 days
- Blocker for form editing workflow
- Tasks: Version tracking, database tables, CLI commands

### Phase 3: Schema Migrations (Medium Priority)

- Estimated effort: 4-5 days
- Blocker for long-term form maintenance
- Tasks: Version tagging, schema adapter, viewer updates

## Benefits
