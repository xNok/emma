# Agent Summary: Architectural Decisions for Foundation Questions

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Related Issue:** Finalize outstanding project foundation questions

## What Was Accomplished

I addressed the three critical architectural questions that were blocking v1.0 development, as outlined in the project foundation discussion.

### 1. Created Comprehensive Architectural Decisions Document

**File:** `docs/05-architectural-decisions.md`

This new document provides formal decisions and detailed specifications for:

#### Authentication Strategy (Section 2)
- **Primary Method**: R2 S3-compatible credentials for secure, least-privileged access
- **Fallback Method**: Wrangler CLI integration for developers already using it
- **Credential Storage**: Encrypted config.json with environment variable support
- **Security Best Practices**: Token scoping, expiration, revocation process
- **Implementation Checklist**: Clear tasks for CLI development

**Key Decision**: Use R2 S3 API credentials instead of full Cloudflare API tokens, providing better security and easier setup.

#### Form Schema Versioning (Section 3)
- **Version Format**: Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Version Increment Rules**: Clear guidelines for when to bump each version component
- **Schema Structure**: Extended YAML format with version history tracking
- **Database Storage**: New `form_versions` table for complete audit trail
- **CLI Workflow**: Automatic version detection and manual override support

**Key Decision**: Use industry-standard semantic versioning with immutable deployments and complete version history.

#### Schema Migrations (Section 4)
- **Core Approach**: Schema-on-read with version tagging (no eager migrations)
- **Submission Storage**: Each submission tagged with schema version at submission time
- **Display Rules**: Flexible views showing current schema, submission schema, or unified view
- **Migration Strategies**: No migration (default), backfill (optional), dual schema (transitional)
- **Database Enhancement**: New schema_version field and field_mappings table

**Key Decision**: Preserve all historical data with lazy schema adaptation on read, avoiding migration downtime and data loss.

### 2. Updated Foundation Document

**File:** `docs/01-project-foundation.md`

- Marked all open questions as resolved
- Added links to specific sections in the new architectural decisions document
- Updated "Next Document" reference to include the new document

### 3. Documentation Quality

The new document includes:
- Clear problem statements for each architectural question
- Requirements analysis for each decision
- Detailed technical specifications
- Implementation checklists for developers
- Database schema changes
- CLI workflow examples
- Security best practices
- Impact analysis on existing documentation
- Implementation roadmap with effort estimates
- Future considerations (not blocking v1.0)

## Implementation Roadmap

The document outlines a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Authentication (Critical Priority)
- Estimated effort: 2-3 days
- Blocker for Cloudflare deployment feature
- Tasks: R2 S3 client, credential management, setup wizard

### Phase 2: Schema Versioning (High Priority)
- Estimated effort: 3-4 days
- Blocker for form editing workflow
- Tasks: Version tracking, database tables, CLI commands

### Phase 3: Schema Migrations (Medium Priority)
- Estimated effort: 4-5 days
- Blocker for long-term form maintenance
- Tasks: Version tagging, schema adapter, viewer updates

## Benefits

1. **Unblocks Development**: All three questions are now formally resolved with actionable specifications
2. **Clear Implementation Path**: Detailed checklists and examples for developers
3. **Security First**: Authentication approach follows least-privilege principle
4. **Data Safety**: Migration strategy ensures no data loss
5. **Industry Standards**: Uses semantic versioning and S3 API standards
6. **Backwards Compatible**: Schema evolution doesn't break existing forms

## Next Steps

This document enables creation of actionable GitHub issues:

1. **Issue: Implement CLI Authentication with R2 S3 API**
   - Reference: Section 2 of architectural decisions
   - Priority: Critical
   - Labels: authentication, cli, deployment

2. **Issue: Add Form Schema Versioning**
   - Reference: Section 3 of architectural decisions
   - Priority: High
   - Labels: schema, versioning, database

3. **Issue: Implement Schema-on-Read Migration Support**
   - Reference: Section 4 of architectural decisions
   - Priority: Medium
   - Labels: migrations, schema, database

4. **Issue: Update Documentation for Authentication Setup**
   - Reference: Section 6.2 of architectural decisions
   - Priority: High
   - Labels: documentation, deployment

## Status

✅ **Discussion Resolved**: All architectural questions formally answered  
✅ **Documentation Complete**: Comprehensive specifications provided  
✅ **Ready for Implementation**: Clear tasks and priorities established

The project foundation questions are now fully addressed and ready for implementation work to begin.
