To get started with Emma, you need to install the `emma-cli` package globally using `npm`.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or higher)
-   npm (v8 or higher)

## Installation Command

```bash
npm install -g @emma-cli/form-builder
```

This will install the `emma` command-line interface (CLI) on your system, allowing you to run `emma` commands from any directory.

## Verify Installation

To ensure the installation was successful, run the following command:

```bash
emma --version
```

This should output the version number of the `emma-cli`, confirming that it has been installed correctly.
